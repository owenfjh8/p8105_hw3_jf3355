#description of data
#There are 15 variables in this dataset:

#order_id: order identifier
#product_id: product identifier
#add_to_cart_order: order in which each product was added to cart
#reordered: 1 if this prodcut has been ordered by this user in the past, 0 otherwise
#user_id: customer identifier
#eval_set: which evaluation set this order belongs in (Note that the data for use in this class is exclusively from the “train” eval_set)
#order_number: the order sequence number for this user (1=first, n=nth)
#order_dow: the day of the week on which the order was placed
#order_hour_of_day: the hour of the day on which the order was placed
#days_since_prior_order: days since the last order, capped at 30, NA if order_number=1
#product_name: name of the product
#aisle_id: aisle identifier
#department_id: department identifier
#aisle: the name of the aisle
#department: the name of the department
```

The dataset has 1384617 observations and 15 columns. There are some key
variable such as product\_name: name of the product,aisle: the name of
the aisle.

How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered
from?

``` r
num_aisle = 
  instacart %>%
  select(aisle)%>%
  n_distinct()
```

There is 134 aisles.

``` r
instacart %>%
  count(aisle) %>%
  arrange(desc(n),1)
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 × 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

From the table, we can see the most items ordered is fresh vegetables.

\#make the plot

\#Problem 2

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
```

\#clean the dataset

``` r
brfss_smart = 
  brfss_smart2010 %>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  filter(topic == "Overall Health")%>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, 
                           levels = c("Poor","Fair","Good","Very Good","Excellent")))%>%
  rename(state = locationabbr, county = locationdesc)%>%
  arrange(response)
```

\#In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
in 2010?

``` r
df_2002 = 
  brfss_smart%>%
  filter(year == "2002")%>%
  group_by(state)%>%
  select(year,state,county)%>%
  distinct()%>%
  summarize(num_locations = n())%>%
  filter(num_locations >=7)
df_2010 = 
  brfss_smart%>%
  filter(year == "2010")%>%
  group_by(state)%>%
  select(year,state,county)%>%
  distinct()%>%
  summarize(num_locations = n())%>%
  filter(num_locations >=7)
```

In 2002,CT,FL,MA,NC,NJ,PA states were observed at 7 or more locations.
In 2010,CA,CO,FL,MA,MD,NC,NE,NJ,NY,OH states were observed at 7 or more
locations.

\#Make the plot of this average value over time within a state

``` r
new_brfss_df= 
  brfss_smart %>%
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>%
  group_by(year,state) %>%
  mutate(mean_value= mean(data_value)) %>%
  group_by(year,state,mean_value) %>%
  summarize() %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= year,y=mean_value,color=state))+geom_line()+labs(
    title = "Average value over time with a state",
    x= "Year",
    y = "Mean of data value"
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` has grouped output by 'year', 'state'. You can override using the `.groups` argument.

# make a two-panel plot

``` r
two_panel_df = 
  brfss_smart %>%
  filter(year%in%c("2006","2010"),state == "NY") %>%
  group_by(year,response,data_value) %>%

           facet_grid(.~year)+
           labs(title= "Response among locations in NY",
         x = "data value",
